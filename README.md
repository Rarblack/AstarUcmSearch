# A Star vs Uniform Cost Search

The project clearly indicates the time and map complexity of 2 different search algorithms, A* and Uniform Cost Search.

The difference between UCS and A* is that A* uses heuristics to compute the weight of an edge, while UCS does not.

## Folder Structure

The code has been seperated into different chunks and located under source folder.

## How to Run

In order to run, type the following in the command line:

python source/main.py

### Commands to use
*LEFT CLICK ON MOUSE*  - puts points on the graph(first, click put start, 2nd click puts end point and the rest of the left clicks will create barrirers on the desired places. 

*RIGHT CLICK ON MOUSE* - erases desired point from the graph.

*c letter*             - resets the graph

*s letter*             - switchs between search algorithms(default is a*)

## Performance Analysis

As it is seen from the output above, even though A* expands less nodes, there is no significant difference.

## Additional Work
In extra section, there is uncomplete code for parsing txt files into appropriate node and edge forms. It has been started, but as a result of the instructor's command has been suspended because of having written done more advance form of it. The codes can be found in extra folder.
