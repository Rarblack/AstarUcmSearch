# A Star vs Uniform Cost Search

The project clearly indicates the time and map complexity of 2 different search algorithms, A* and Uniform Cost Search.

The difference between UCS and A* is that A* uses heuristics to compute the weight of an edge, while UCS does not.

## Folder Structure

The code has been separated into different chunks and located under the source folder.

## How to Run

In order to run, type the following in the command line:

python source/main.py

## Commands to Use
*LEFT CLICK ON MOUSE*  - puts points on the graph(first, click put start, 2nd click puts end point and the rest of the left-clicks will create barriers on the desired places. 

*RIGHT CLICK ON MOUSE* - erases desired point from the graph.

*c letter*             - resets the graph

*s letter*             - switches between search algorithms(default is a*)

## Performance Analysis

As it is seen from the output above, even though A* expands fewer nodes, there is no significant difference.

## Comparison of 2 Algorithms
Most of the time heuristic A* overcome UCM and can easily be detected through the graph.

## Additional Work
In the extra folder, there are mainly completed project scripts, however are currently in not working conditions. The intention to show the progress and mainly indicate the structure of parsing script to parse txt files into an appropriate node and edge forms. It has been started, but as a result of the instructor's command has been suspended because of having written done more advanced form of it.
